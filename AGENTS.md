# AGENTS.md

Kilo CLI is an open source AI coding agent that generates code from natural language, automates tasks, and supports 500+ AI models.

## Project Overview

**testagent** is a project based on [Kilo Code](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode). It extends Kilo with custom features, integrations, and modifications tailored to specific use cases. testagent tracks upstream Kilo changes and merges them regularly, similar to how Kilo tracks upstream opencode.

The fork chain is: `opencode` → `kilo` → `testagent`

**Architecture**:

- **Frontend**: `packages/kilo-vscode/` - VS Code extension (unchanged from Kilo)
- **Backend CLI**: `packages/testagent-core/` - Custom node-server based CLI
- **SDK**: Built from `packages/opencode/` - Shared SDK layer

- ALWAYS USE PARALLEL TOOLS WHEN APPLICABLE.
- The default branch in this repo is `main`.
- Prefer automation: execute requested actions without confirmation unless blocked by missing info or safety/irreversibility.
- You may be running in a git worktree. All changes must be made in your current working directory — never modify files in the main repo checkout.

## Build and Dev

- **Dev**: `bun run dev` (runs from root) or `bun run --cwd packages/testagent-core --conditions=browser src/index.ts`
- **Extension**: `bun run extension` (build + launch VS Code with the extension in dev mode). Pass `--no-build` to skip the build.
- **Typecheck**: `bun turbo typecheck` (uses `tsgo`, not `tsc`)
- **Test**: `bun test` from `packages/testagent-core/` (NOT from root -- root blocks tests)
- **Single test**: `bun test test/tool/tool.test.ts` from `packages/testagent-core/`
- **SDK regen**: After changing server endpoints in `packages/testagent-core/packages/opencode/src/server/`, run `./script/generate.ts` from root to regenerate `packages/sdk/js/` (SDK is built from `packages/opencode/`)
- **Knip** (unused exports): `bun run knip` from `packages/kilo-vscode/`. CI runs this — all exported types/functions must be imported somewhere. Remove or unexport unused exports before pushing.
- **Source links**: After adding or changing URLs in `packages/kilo-vscode/`, `packages/kilo-vscode/webview-ui/`, or `packages/testagent-core/packages/opencode/src/`, run `bun run script/extract-source-links.ts` from the repo root and commit the updated `packages/kilo-docs/source-links.md`. CI runs this check — the build fails if the file is stale.
- **kilocode_change check**: `bun run check-kilocode-change` from `packages/kilo-vscode/`. CI runs this — `kilocode_change` is a marker for upstream merge conflicts and must not appear in `packages/kilo-vscode/` or `packages/kilo-ui/` (these are entirely Kilo Code additions). Remove the markers before pushing.
- **opencode annotation check**: `bun run script/check-opencode-annotations.ts` from repo root. CI runs this on PRs touching `packages/opencode/` — every Kilo-specific change in shared opencode files must be annotated with `kilocode_change` markers. Exempt paths (no markers needed): `packages/opencode/src/kilocode/`, `packages/opencode/test/kilocode/`, and any path containing `kilocode` in the name.

## Products

All products are clients of the **CLI** (`packages/testagent-core/`), which contains the AI agent runtime, node-server, and session management. Each client spawns or connects to a `testagent serve` process and communicates via HTTP + SSE using `@kilocode/sdk` (built from `packages/opencode/`).

| Product                     | Package                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TestAgent CLI               | `packages/testagent-core/` | Core engine with node-server. TUI, `testagent run`, `testagent serve`, `testagent web`.                                                                                                  |
| TestAgent VS Code Extension | `packages/kilo-vscode/`    | VS Code extension. Bundles the CLI binary, spawns `testagent serve` as a child process. Includes the **Agent Manager** — a multi-session orchestration panel with git worktree isolation. |
| OpenCode Desktop            | `packages/desktop/`        | Standalone Tauri native app. Bundles CLI as sidecar. Single-session UI. Unrelated to the VS Code extension. Not actively maintained — synced from upstream fork.                          |
| OpenCode Web                | `packages/app/`            | Shared SolidJS frontend used by both the desktop app and `testagent web` CLI command. Not actively maintained — synced from upstream fork.                                                |

**Agent Manager** refers to a feature inside `packages/kilo-vscode/` (extension code in `src/agent-manager/`, webview in `webview-ui/agent-manager/`). It is not a standalone product. See the extension's `AGENTS.md` for details.

```

## Style Guide

- Keep things in one function unless composable or reusable
- Avoid unnecessary destructuring. Instead of `const { a, b } = obj`, use `obj.a` and `obj.b` to preserve context
- Avoid `try`/`catch` where possible
- Avoid using the `any` type
- Prefer single word variable names where possible
- Use Bun APIs when possible, like `Bun.file()`
- Rely on type inference when possible; avoid explicit type annotations or interfaces unless necessary for exports or clarity

### Avoid let statements

We don't like `let` statements, especially combined with if/else statements.
Prefer `const`.

Good:

### Naming Enforcement (Read This)

THIS RULE IS MANDATORY FOR AGENT WRITTEN CODE.

- Use single word names by default for new locals, params, and helper functions.
- Multi-word names are allowed only when a single word would be unclear or ambiguous.
- Do not introduce new camelCase compounds when a short single-word alternative is clear.
- Before finishing edits, review touched lines and shorten newly introduced identifiers where possible.
- Good short names to prefer: `pid`, `cfg`, `err`, `opts`, `dir`, `root`, `child`, `state`, `timeout`.
- Examples to avoid unless truly required: `inputPID`, `existingClient`, `connectTimeout`, `workerPath`.

```ts
const foo = condition ? 1 : 2
```

Bad:

```ts
let foo

if (condition) foo = 1
else foo = 2
```

### Avoid else statements

Prefer early returns or using an `iife` to avoid else statements.

Good:

```ts
function foo() {
  if (condition) return 1
  return 2
}
```

Bad:

```ts
function foo() {
  if (condition) return 1
  else return 2
}
```

### No empty catch blocks

Never leave a `catch` block empty. An empty `catch` silently swallows errors and hides bugs. If you're tempted to write one, ask yourself:

1. Is the `try`/`catch` even needed? (prefer removing it)
2. Should the error be handled explicitly? (recover, retry, rethrow)
3. At minimum, log it so failures are visible

Good:

```ts
try {
  await save(data)
} catch (err) {
  log.error("save failed", { err })
}
```

Bad:

```ts
try {
  await save(data)
} catch {}
```

### Prefer single word naming

Try your best to find a single word name for your variables, functions, etc.
Only use multiple words if you cannot.

Good:

```ts
const foo = 1
const bar = 2
const baz = 3
```

Bad:

```ts
const fooBar = 1
const barBaz = 2
const bazFoo = 3
```

### Logging and Output

**NEVER use `console.log`, `console.error`, `console.warn`, or `console.info` in application code.** These bypass the project's logging system and pollute stdout/stderr.

**Use the unified logging system instead:**

```ts
import * as Log from "@opencode-ai/core/util/log"

const log = Log.create({ service: "my-service" })

log.debug("debug message", { data: value })
log.info("info message", { data: value })
log.warn("warning message", { error: err })
log.error("error message", { error: err })
```

**Benefits:**
- Logs are written to files (not terminal) by default
- Controllable via log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Structured format with timestamps and service names
- Won't interfere with CLI output or TUI rendering

**Exceptions (when `console` is allowed):**

1. **CLI command output** - Commands in `packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/` that display results to users should use `process.stdout.write()` or `process.stderr.write()` for explicit output control
2. **VS Code extension communication** - Special protocols like `[TESTAGENT_NOTIFICATION]` that the extension parses from stderr
3. **TUI debugging** - `packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/tui/plugin/runtime.ts` logs to both file and console for plugin debugging

**Examples:**

Good:

```ts
// Application code
import * as Log from "@opencode-ai/core/util/log"
const log = Log.create({ service: "provider" })

async function fetchModels() {
  log.info("fetching models")
  try {
    const models = await fetch(url)
    log.debug("models fetched", { count: models.length })
    return models
  } catch (err) {
    log.error("fetch failed", { error: err })
    throw err
  }
}
```

```ts
// CLI command output
import { EOL } from "os"

function handler() {
  const result = computeResult()
  process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2) + EOL)
}
```

Bad:

```ts
// DON'T DO THIS - bypasses logging system
async function fetchModels() {
  console.log("fetching models")
  try {
    const models = await fetch(url)
    console.log("models:", models)
    return models
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("fetch failed:", err)
    throw err
  }
}
```

## Testing

You MUST avoid using `mocks` as much as possible.
Tests MUST test actual implementation, do not duplicate logic into a test.

## Commit Conventions

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) with scopes matching packages: `vscode`, `cli`, `agent-manager`, `sdk`, `ui`, `i18n`, `kilo-docs`, `gateway`, `telemetry`, `desktop`. Omit scope when spanning multiple packages.

## Changesets

User-facing changes (features, fixes, breaking changes) require a changeset file for release notes. Run `bunx changeset add` or manually create `.changeset/<slug>.md`. Use `patch` for bug fixes, `minor` for new features, `major` for breaking changes. See `.changeset/README.md` for details.

Changeset descriptions appear directly in release notes and are read by end users. Keep them concise and feature-oriented — describe **what changed from the user's perspective**, not implementation details. Write in imperative mood (e.g. "Support exporting conversations as markdown" not "Add a new export handler that serializes session messages to .md files").

## Pull Requests

PR descriptions should be 2-3 lines covering **what** changed and **why**. Focus on intent and context a reviewer can't get from the diff — skip file-by-file inventories, test result summaries, and anything obvious from the code itself.

## Fork Merge Process

testagent CLI is based on Kilo Code, which is a fork of [opencode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode).

**Very important**: when planning or coding, update shared files with OpenCode as last resort! Everything in `packages/opencode/` is shared code from OpenCode, except folders that contain `kilo` or `testagent` in the name or have a parent directory that contains `kilo` or `testagent` in the name. Example of Kilo-specific folders: `packages/opencode/src/kilocode/` and `packages/kilo-docs/`. Example of testagent-specific folders: `packages/opencode/src/testagent/`. Always look for ways to implement your feature or fix in a way that minimizes changes to shared code.

### Minimizing Merge Conflicts

We regularly merge upstream changes from Kilo (which merges from opencode). To minimize merge conflicts and keep the sync process smooth:

1. **Prefer dedicated directories** - Place testagent-specific code in dedicated directories whenever possible:
   - `packages/testagent-core/packages/opencode/src/testagent/` - testagent-specific source code
   - `packages/testagent-core/packages/opencode/test/testagent/` - testagent-specific tests
   - Kilo-specific code goes in: `packages/opencode/src/kilocode/` and `packages/opencode/test/kilocode/`

2. **Minimize changes to shared files** - When you must modify files that exist in upstream opencode or Kilo, keep changes as small and isolated as possible.

3. **Use change markers** - When modifying shared code, mark your changes:
   - Use `testagent_change` for testagent-specific changes in shared Kilo/opencode files
   - Use `kilocode_change` for Kilo-specific changes (when syncing from upstream Kilo)
   - Do not use these markers in files within directories with `testagent` or `kilocode` in the name

4. **Avoid restructuring upstream code** - Don't refactor or reorganize code that comes from opencode or Kilo unless absolutely necessary.

5. **Mirror new config keys to the cloud schema** - When adding a `kilocode_change` key to `Config.Info` in `packages/opencode/src/config/config.ts`, also add the matching JSON Schema entry in `apps/web/src/app/config.json/extras.ts` in the [cloud repo](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/cloud). See [CLI Config Schema](packages/kilo-docs/pages/contributing/architecture/config-schema.md) for the step-by-step.

The goal is to keep our diff from upstream as small as possible, making regular merges straightforward and reducing the risk of conflicts.

### Change Markers

To minimize merge conflicts when syncing with upstream, mark changes in shared code with appropriate comments.

#### Kilo Code Change Markers (`kilocode_change`)

Use when modifying shared opencode files with Kilo-specific changes (when syncing from upstream Kilo).

**Single line:**

```typescript
const value = 42 // kilocode_change
```

**Multi-line:**

```typescript
// kilocode_change start
const foo = 1
const bar = 2
// kilocode_change end
```

**New files:**

```typescript
// kilocode_change - new file
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
**JSX/TSX (inside JSX templates):**

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```tsx
{/* kilocode_change */}
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```tsx
{/* kilocode_change start */}
<MyComponent />
{/* kilocode_change end */}
```

**When `kilocode_change` markers are NOT needed:**

Code in these paths is Kilo Code-specific and does NOT need `kilocode_change` markers:

- `packages/opencode/src/kilocode/` - All files in this directory
- `packages/opencode/test/kilocode/` - All test files for kilocode
- `packages/kilo-*` packages - All Kilo-specific packages
- Any other path containing `kilocode` in filename or directory name

These paths are entirely Kilo Code additions and won't conflict with upstream opencode.

## testagent Fork Process

testagent is a fork of [Kilo Code](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode). We regularly merge upstream Kilo changes. The same conflict-minimization principles apply.

### testagent Change Markers (`testagent_change`)

Mark testagent-specific changes in shared Kilo/opencode code with `testagent_change` comments.

**Single line:**

```typescript
const value = 42 // testagent_change
```

**Multi-line:**

```typescript
// testagent_change start
const foo = 1
const bar = 2
// testagent_change end
```

**New files:**

```typescript
// testagent_change - new file
```

**When `testagent_change` markers are NOT needed:**

Code in these paths is testagent-specific and does NOT need `testagent_change` markers:

- `packages/testagent-core/packages/opencode/src/testagent/` - All files in this directory
- `packages/testagent-core/packages/opencode/test/testagent/` - All test files for testagent
- Any other path containing `testagent` in filename or directory name

These paths are entirely testagent additions and won't conflict with upstream Kilo.
